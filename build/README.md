# raghavp96.github.io

This website contains the build output of https://github.com/raghavp96/website. To allow me to use my user profile's namespace (raghavp96.github.io) and not a project one, I needed the `master` branch to contain the build output. I've got around this by keeping my source code in one repo and the build output in another.
