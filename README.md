# Website

This is my website, written in Elm! This is my first extensive project with Elm and I learned a lot - there's still a lot of stuff I don't know, but it's a start `:)`. This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).


## Available scripts

In the project directory you can run:

- `elm-app start` : Runs the app in the development mode. The browser should open automatically to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If the browser does not open, you can open it manually and visit the URL. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- `elm-app install` : Alias for [`elm install`](http://guide.elm-lang.org/get_started.html#elm-install). Used for installing Elm packages from [package.elm-lang.org](http://package.elm-lang.org/)

- `elm-app test` : Runs tests with [node-test-runner](https://github.com/rtfeldman/node-test-runner/tree/master)

- `elm-app build` : Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. App is ready to be deployed! (Calling the deploy script instead is porbably safer)

## Notes

## Build, Push, Deploy
- I've configured two remotes:
    ```
    origin	https://github.com/raghavp96/website.git (fetch)
    origin	https://github.com/raghavp96/website.git (push)
    public	https://github.com/raghavp96/raghavp96.github.io.git (fetch)
    public	https://github.com/raghavp96/raghavp96.github.io.git (push)
    ```

- I want to not have to deal with building the app and pushing the build output to Github on my `master` branch, but Github Pages requires it (otherwise I wouldn't be able to use the default user namespace for my website). The `public` remote's master branch is where I push the build output, keeping it away from the source code (which remains in `origin master`.

- To push then - we run `./deploy.sh`, which will:
    - push the committed source code to `origin master` 
    - build the project with `elm-app build`, push the build folder to `public master`
